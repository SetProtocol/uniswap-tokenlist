    "setDescription": "MoonQuant's MainCrypto TrendBlazer Set rebalances among mainstream crypto assets (BTC, ETH, LINK), and a stablecoin.\n\nMQMCâ€™s objective is to take advantage of efficient diversification strategies based on modern portfolio theory while maintaining positive exposure to crypto markets.\n\nThe MoonQuant algorithm analyzes multi-time frame indicators to determine market direction and position sizing. It is not a scalping bot, nor does it seek to catch tops and bottoms. It utilizes a proprietary signal awareness engine which seeks to determine best-performing and efficient rebalancing strategies.\n\nMQMC seeks to outperform indices (and 'hodling') while minimizing downside, always under the oversight of professional portfolio managers.\n\nMQMC is not a regulated investment vehicle and MoonQuant is not a regulated investment advisor. An investor may get back less than the amount invested.\n\nPlease note that MoonQuant or Token Sets reserve the right to amend the operation of the set.\n\nTHE RISK OF INVESTING IN CRYPTOCURRENCIES OR CRYPTO RELATED ASSETS IS SUBSTANTIAL AND CAN RESULT IN A COMPLETE LOSS OF FUNDS. INVESTORS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH AN INVESTMENT IS SUITABLE FOR THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION. INVESTORS SHOULD SEEK INDEPENDENT, PROFESSIONAL LEGAL, TAX & INVESTMENT ADVICE. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.",
