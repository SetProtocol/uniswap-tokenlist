    "setDescription": "MQFI offers a USD denominated, conservative investment strategy, similar to competitive fixed income instruments. It's specifically developed for investors who want exposure to the benefits of cryptocurrencies—flexibility, efficiency, pseudo anonymity, censorship resistance—-but seek to stay away from crypto volatility.\n\nMQFI balances both a volatile asset (either ETH or WBTC) and a stablecoin (DAI). The volatile asset component is triggered only when clear momentum signal markers are identified.  Positions are taken for short periods of time, seeking to achieve a 1.5% monthly upside target. When the target is reached, MQFI automatically rebalances back to DAI.\n\nMQFI's algorithm strives for capital preservation, positioning holdings in DAI before reaching negative territory, waiting for the right conditions to generate the next month’s objective.\n\nSpecifications for MQFI's algorithm: aims to accrue 1.5% growth every month. During the course of each month, MQFI's probabilistic markers (used in higher volatility bots) seek to identify clear bull trends to enter conservative long positions. Once the monthly target is achieved, no additional risk is taken. The target yearly net returns of 12% are achieved by compounding a minimum 1.5% monthly return, minus network, rebalancing costs and fees.\n\nMQFI is not a regulated investment vehicle and MoonQuant is not a regulated investment advisor. An investor may get back less than the amount invested.\n\nPlease note that MoonQuant or Token Sets reserve the right to amend the operation of the set.\n\nTHE RISK OF INVESTING IN CRYPTOCURRENCIES OR CRYPTO RELATED ASSETS IS SUBSTANTIAL AND CAN RESULT IN A COMPLETE LOSS OF FUNDS. INVESTORS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH AN INVESTMENT IS SUITABLE FOR THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION. INVESTORS SHOULD SEEK INDEPENDENT, PROFESSIONAL LEGAL, TAX & INVESTMENT ADVICE. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.",
