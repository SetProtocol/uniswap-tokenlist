Rebalances are executed through the SetsProtocol** /n/n**An investor may get back less than the amount invested. Information on past performance, where given, is not a guide to future performance** /n/nThe algorithm behind the BYTE3 set incorporates four network demand metrics across six different indicators, to give an overall allocation score. These metrics are Network Fees, Transaction Value, Velocity and Minersâ€™ Change in Inventory.
