    "setDescription": "The DeFi Pulse Index is a capitalization-weighted index that tracks the performance of decentralized financial assets across the market.\n\nObjective\nThe DeFi Pulse Index is a digital asset index designed to track tokens’ performance within the Decentralized Finance industry. The index is weighted based on the value of each token’s circulating supply. The DeFi Pulse Index aims to track projects in Decentralized Finance that have significant usage and show a commitment to ongoing maintenance and development.\n\nView the methodology: https://www.pulse.inc/\n\nToken Inclusion Criteria\nThe DeFi Pulse Index has a collection of criteria composed of four dimensions. Two dimensions are used to evaluate the token’s characteristics, one dimension is used to assess the project’s characteristics, and one is used to evaluate the protocol’s characteristics. The inclusion criteria are the basis to select what tokens will be included in the index.\n\nToken’s Descriptive Characteristics\nThe token must be available on the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe token must be associated with a decentralized finance protocol or dapp listed on DeFi Pulse.\nThe token must not be considered a security by the corresponding authorities across different jurisdictions.\n\nThe token must be a bearer instrument. None of the following will be included in the index:Wrapped tokens. Tokenized derivatives. Synthetic assets. Tokens that are tied to physical assets. Tokens that represent claims on other tokens.\n\nToken’s Supply Characteristics\nIt must be possible to reasonably predict the token’s supply over the next five years.\nAt least 5% of the five year supply must be currently circulating.\nThe token’s economics must not have locking, minting or other patterns that would significantly disadvantage passive holders.\n\nProject’s Traction Characteristics\nThe project must be widely considered to be building a useful protocol or product.Projects focused on competitive trading/holding, having Ponzi characteristics, or projects that exist primarily for entertainment, will not be included.\nThe project’s protocol must have significant usage.\nThe protocol or product must have been launched at least 180 days before being able to qualify to be included in the index.\nThe protocol or project must not be insolvent.\n\nProtocol’s User Safety Characteristics\nSecurity professionals must have reviewed the protocol to determine that security best practices have been followed to maintain user assets safe under different circumstances.Alternatively, the protocol must have been operating long enough to create a consensus about its safety in the decentralized finance community.\n\nIn the event of a safety incident, the team must have responded promptly and addressed the incident responsibly in the aftermath, providing users of the protocol with a reliable solution and the decentralized finance community with adequate documentation to provide transparency about the incident.\nThe selected tokens must have sufficient liquidity across a variety of trading platforms.\n\nIndex Maintenance\nThe index is maintained monthly in two phases:\n\nDetermination Phase\nThe determination phase takes place during the third week of the month. It is the phase when the changes needed for the next reconstitution are determined.\nCirculating Supply Determination: The DeFi Pulse Index currently references CoinGecko’s circulating supply number. The Circulating Supply is determined during the third week of the month and published before the monthly reconstitution.\nAdditions and deletions: The tokens being added and deleted from the index calculation are determined during the third week of the month and published before monthly reconstitution.\n\nReconstitution Phase\nThe index components are adjusted, added and deleted as per the instructions published after the end of the determination phase. New index weights, additions and deletions are incorporated into the index during the monthly reconstitution, which will take place on the first business day of the month. As assets tracked by the index grow, the reconstitution window will expand to more than one day to lower the reconstitution’s market impact.",
