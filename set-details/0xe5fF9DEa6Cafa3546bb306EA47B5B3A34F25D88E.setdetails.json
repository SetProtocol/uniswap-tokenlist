Since our intention is to maximize returns, we will take immediate action by timing the highs and lows of the market over the coming years. We will increase or decrease our leveraged positions depending on the liquidity on the DEX. Our goal is macro market timing so that participants don't have to suffer the downside in a bear market. Regular updates on strategy or changes in portfolio composition are communicated on our Twitter account. Investors will also receive this information via our monthly newsletter.",
