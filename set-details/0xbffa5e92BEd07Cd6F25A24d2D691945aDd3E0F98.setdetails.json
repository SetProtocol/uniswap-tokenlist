    "setDescription": "MoonQuant’s Trailblazer BTC set rebalances 2X leveraged BTC against a stablecoin. The MoonQuant algorithm analyzes multi-time frame indicators to determine market direction and position sizing. It is not a scalping bot, nor does it seek to catch tops and bottoms. It utilizes a proprietary signal awareness engine which seeks to determine best-performing and efficient rebalancing strategies.\n\n\n\nMQTBB seeks to outperform indices (and ‘hodling’) while minimizing downside, always under the oversight of professional portfolio managers.\n\nMQTBB is not a regulated investment vehicle and MoonQuant is not a regulated investment advisor. An investor may get back less than the amount invested. \n\nPlease note that MoonQuant or Token Sets reserve the right to amend the operation of the set.\n\nFEES: In addition to streaming fee, this set will collect a performance fee equal to 10% of net gains, calculated per calendar month. These fees will be charged by rebalancing the fee amount into a FEES token, that will act as a fee collection mechanism.\n\nTHE RISK OF INVESTING IN CRYPTOCURRENCIES OR CRYPTO RELATED ASSETS IS SUBSTANTIAL AND CAN RESULT IN A COMPLETE LOSS OF FUNDS. INVESTORS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER WHETHER SUCH AN INVESTMENT IS SUITABLE FOR THEM IN LIGHT OF THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION. INVESTORS SHOULD SEEK INDEPENDENT, PROFESSIONAL LEGAL, TAX & INVESTMENT ADVICE. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.  ",
