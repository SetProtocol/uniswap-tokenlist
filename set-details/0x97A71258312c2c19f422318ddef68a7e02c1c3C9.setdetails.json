    "setDescription": "The Defi Momentum Index is an algorithmically rebalanced token set with an emphasis on short-to-medium term price action\n\nObjective\nThe set aims to provide users with exposure to eth/usd (weth/usdc) while systematically hedging against downside risk. The set will initialize as 100% usd and will be dollar-cost-averaged into its target rebalance ratio.\n\nSet Parameters:\n  - Underlying Asset: ETH\n  - Rebalance Ratio (Start): 0:100\n  - Rebalance Ratio (Target): 80:20\n  - Rebalance Ratio (Max): 100:0\n  - Rebalance Ratio (Min): 60:40\n\nStrategy\nThe set runs an aggressive momentum based 1x leveraged spot rebalancing strategy. The rebalancing strategy is powered by the DeepRSI trading engine with token rebalances occurring daily. Returns from the rebalancing strategy are rolled back into ETH so as to maintain set equilibrium.
