    "setDescription": "A strategy that transcends the basic “buy & hold” method, offering a more refined way to manage your Bitcoin exposure. It optimizes the long-term risk-to-reward ratio of a Bitcoin investment, by seamlessly converting to a USD-pegged stablecoin during significant price dips, and being fully invested in Bitcoin during upward market trends. This procedure empowers you to accumulate more Bitcoin over time, resulting in a stronger, more resilient crypto portfolio.\n\nA mathematically-driven system based on raw Price Action, designed using broad market analysis instead of specific data events. This approach ensures the system's robustness and adaptability in a wide range of market conditions, resulting in a steadily growing equity curve and providing a reliable, long-term investment solution.\n\nThis is a non-custodial asset management product.\nMore info & trackrecord at betterthanhold.com",
